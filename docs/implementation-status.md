# Implementation status

Last updated: 2026-07-09.

## Current phase

The canonical-history and replacement-base cutover is complete on XRPL Devnet. Production history runs in verified hybrid mode: immutable canonical history covers ledgers `3371676..3432924`, and D1 live continuation covers the boundary after ledger `3432924`. The active current-state base is `devnet-3432924-canonical` at ledger `3432924`.

M1 exit is complete. M5-5 real-data integration remains active. M6 remains gated behind M5-5 browser evidence and has not started.

The retained M5-5 API-level production cross-audit evidence from `2026-07-08 00:52:38 UTC` remains passing. The remaining M5-5 exit requirement is production-shaped browser evidence plus the fail-closed browser exit evaluator.

## Active blocker — scheduled collector CPU exhaustion

The date-guarded M5-5 browser evidence path did not become exit evidence. The current active blocker is the production scheduled collector, not D1 daily headroom.

Cloudflare production Observability on `2026-07-09` showed repeated scheduled events with:

- `eventType`: `cron`;
- `cron`: `* * * * *`;
- `outcome`: `exceededCpu`;
- `cpuTimeMs`: `10`;
- wall time roughly 4-6 seconds.

The GitHub catch-up runtime monitor rerun after the UTC-day reset showed D1 usage had recovered, but collector cursor still did not advance. Therefore M5-5 browser regression remains blocked until the scheduled collector can run without Worker CPU termination and produce retained recovery evidence.

The active recovery unit is PR #296, which changes the production Worker schedule from every minute to five-minute cadence and reduces per-run incremental collector budgets for Cloudflare Worker Free operation. This is a free-tier stability compromise, not a claim of strict real-time operation.

## Latest retained runtime evidence

### HYB-7 and M1

The retained M1 exit evidence at `2026-07-08 00:13:44 UTC` recorded collector healthy, cursor/head `3476415`, lag `0`, zero consecutive failures, HYB-7 `passed: true`, M1 diagnostics `ready: true`, and bounded replacement-base, hybrid-history, Overview, and current list/detail exact-read checks passing.

### M5-5 production cross-audit

At `2026-07-08 00:52:38 UTC`, the D1-gated production cross-audit passed with collector healthy, cursor/head `3477191`, lag `0`, active snapshot `devnet-3432924-canonical`, sampled Vault/Broker/Loan relationships, lifecycle/current/history checks, archive exclusion, Activity classification, Cover & Loss availability, exports/feed, and D1 headroom passing.

### Browser prerequisite and resource gate

The durable production browser-regression path is merged and validated in CI. It discovers bounded live witnesses, traverses 15 representative routes, performs relationship/history/archive/Search/freshness behavior checks, records request-count evidence, retains `runner.log`, and fails on rendered state errors, console errors, page errors, HTTP 5xx findings, or missing required behavior.

The browser exit evaluator is merged and writes `exit-evaluation.json` and `exit-evaluation.md`. A passing evaluator marks browser evidence ready for M5-5 exit reconciliation, but retained API cross-audit evidence remains a separate prerequisite.

No browser pass is claimed while the production collector remains CPU-blocked.

## Explorer v1 pre-entry design preparation

Documentation-only Explorer v1 pre-entry design preparation is complete and formalized. This preparation does not start E1-1 and does not change runtime behavior, public routes, API contracts, collector behavior, D1 persistence, schedules, deployment, or resource thresholds.

Prepared Explorer documents:

- `docs/explorer-v1-visual-direction.md`;
- `docs/explorer-v1-contract-matrix.md`;
- `docs/explorer-v1-translation-dictionary.md`;
- `docs/explorer-v1-content-copy.md`;
- `docs/explorer-v1-relationship-contract.md`;
- `docs/explorer-v1-static-api-shape-audit.md`.

Explorer v1 remains gated behind M5-5 exit plus the required M6 integrity/reset and runtime/resource baselines.

## Approved Explorer and Observatory sequence

The approved order is:

```text
M5-5 completion
  -> M6 integrity/reset baseline
  -> M6 runtime/resource guardrail baseline
  -> Explorer v1
  -> remaining M6 visual/release hardening
  -> public Devnet release and real soak
  -> O1 XRPL Lending Observatory data foundation
  -> O2 Observatory monitoring view
  -> O3 Explorer v2
```

Explorer v1 is a bounded presentation layer over approved contracts. It must not add a separate collector, scheduled job, request-time full-history scan, or Explorer-specific historical analytics pipeline.

## Active unit

The active implementation unit is free-tier scheduled collector recovery.

1. Merge and deploy the five-minute free-tier collector configuration only after review.
2. Verify Cloudflare scheduled events no longer report `outcome=exceededCpu`.
3. Verify `/api/status/collector` shows advancing cursor evidence (`cursor_delta > 0`) and no consecutive failures.
4. Rerun the catch-up runtime monitor and retain the artifact.
5. Return to M5-5 browser evidence only after collector recovery is retained.

Track A — M5-5 browser evidence — remains blocked until collector recovery evidence is captured. Track B — production UI audit — also remains gated by measured current-day headroom and collector health.

Neither track may weaken collector integrity, D1 resource gates, or browser exit criteria.

## Prepared post-M5-5 units

Preparation is complete for the first two M6 hardening areas, but execution has not started.

- `docs/m6-integrity-reset-plan.md` defines the first executable M6 integrity/reset baseline after M5-5 exit.
- `docs/m6-i1-fixture-catalog.md` prepares deterministic M6-I1 F00-F14 scenarios, shared context/object/asset families, evidence snapshot requirements, and M6-I2-I5 reuse.
- `docs/m6-resource-guardrail-plan.md` defines the early M6 runtime/resource measurement order, evidence contract, budget-approval process, and Explorer v1 resource-harness gate.

M6-I1 may begin only after M5-5 exits and after issue #283, the fixture catalog, and existing helper inventory are reviewed.

## Next order

1. Complete PR #296 review for free-tier collector recovery.
2. Deploy the five-minute/free-tier collector configuration.
3. Confirm Cloudflare scheduled events stop producing `exceededCpu`.
4. Confirm collector cursor advancement and retained catch-up runtime monitor evidence.
5. Run or rerun M5-5 browser regression only after collector preflight and D1 headroom gates pass.
6. Inspect `summary.json`, `summary.md`, `runner.log`, `exit-evaluation.json`, `exit-evaluation.md`, collector preflight, and D1 headroom evidence.
7. Reconcile M5-5 exit only when retained API and browser evidence both satisfy their gates.
8. After M5-5 exits, begin M6-I1 using `docs/m6-integrity-reset-plan.md`, `docs/m6-i1-fixture-catalog.md`, and issue #283 after inventorying existing helpers.

## Remaining blockers

- Production scheduled collector recovery evidence is missing after the `exceededCpu` Cloudflare events.
- M5-5 API cross-audit evidence is passing, but real-data browser regression and representative browser production behavior evidence remain pending before M5-5 exit.
- The independent production UI audit remains separately gated by measured current-day headroom and collector health.
- M6 plans and M6-I1 fixture catalog are prepared, but M6 execution remains blocked until M5-5 exit.
- Explorer v1 implementation remains blocked until M5-5 exit plus the M6 integrity/reset and runtime/resource start gates.
- Final-host SEO binding and remaining M6 release hardening remain pending in roadmap order.
- Observatory O1-O3 remains post-release and post-soak work.
